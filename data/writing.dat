You have written well. Your writing follows a clear and easy progression. <br/>However, I think you need to work on the following points to improve your writing: <br/>Capitalisation: e.g. 'my (C)(>>My )name is Natalia.'. Always capitalise the first word in a sentence. <br/>Articles: e.g. 'I'm (AR)(>>a )trener(SP)(>>trainer).'. Count nouns need a definite/indefinite article when singular. ‘A’ or ‘an’ is used when the noun is non-specific. <br/>Spelling: e.g. 'trener(SP)(>>trainer)', 'becouse(SP)(>>because)'. Always run a spell check before you submit your writing. <br/>Try to read more English books, newspapers or magazines to help familiarise yourself with written English. I am sure, with some effort, you can do much better. I look forward to seeing excellent writings from you. All the best!	5322	my name is Natalia. I work in sport school. I'm trener.

Your short review on food  is well thought out. <br/><br/>Review: <br/>I am glad you understood the topic well. Your overall performance is satisfactory. Please write the word limit prescribed for the level in your future writings.  <br/><br/>Focus on subject and verb agreement.  The subject and verb must agree in number: both must be singular, or both must  be plural.Example: The potatoes were perfect. <br/><br/>It was a chocolate cake covered by (PR)(>>with )ice cream. <br/>In the above sentence the preposition 'by' is inappropriately used, so I have changed it to 'with'. <br/><br/>The word 'so' doesn't fit the context of the sentence, so I have changed it to 'overall' which means 'in general'.   Example: Overall, the food was delicious. <br/><br/>Read books to improve your skills. The more you read, the more you improve.

But a few months ago, Dave had trouble with his job and thus he started to drink. Before this problem with his job, he was kind, gentle and loving but when he started drinking he started to be really violent. Nevertheless, Serena loved her husband and tried to get used to it, thinking the sitution would not last. Last week, as it was Dave's mother birthday, she came to visit them for a week. During this week it was particularly difficult for Serena because Dave was drinking even more than usually and her mother-in-law was always behind her criticising her. One night, as Dave was coming back from the bar more drunk than ever he started to shout at Serena pretending everything was her fault and that he should never had married her. While he was claiming those horror to Serena, she could not stand more and wanted him to stop yelling. She did not know how to make him stop, but she wanted it so badly that without thinking she took a knife and stab him. While stabbing him, Dave stopped yelling and screamed looking at her. When she finally realised what she had done, Serena started to cry as she did not know how to fix her mistake.

You did a great job and it was a pleasure grading your work.<br/><br/>Spelling is an important part of any language. Make sure your spelling is correct by doing a quick spell check. This will improve and help you with the use of words.<br/><br/>Use commas to separate independent clauses in a sentence, for example:<br/>- The class was over, but the students refused to leave.<br/>- Yesterday was her mother's birthday, so she took her out to dinner.<br/><br/>When you are writing about two or more people or things the noun should be placed in plural form by using a 's', 'ies' or an 'e'. For example: <br/>* apple - apples <br/>* shoe - shoes <br/>* man - men<br/>* company - companies<br/><br/>Keep up the good work and do different grammar exercises daily to help you improve. Good luck with your future English studies.<br/><br/>Kind regards, <br/>Janita	8599	Serena Nelson is a lovely young woman living in the suburb of Chicago. Last year, she married Dave. Since their wedding everything has been perfect. But a few months ago, Dave had trouble with his job and thus he started to drink. Before this problem with his job, he was kind, gentle and loving but when he started drinking he started to be really violent. Nevertheless, Serena loved her husband and tried to get used to it, thinking the sitution would not last. Last week, as it was Dave's mother birthday, she came to visit them for a week. During this week it was particularly difficult for Serena because Dave was drinking even more than usually and her mother-in-law was always behind her criticising her. One night, as Dave was coming back from the bar more drunk than ever he started to shout at Serena pretending everything was her fault and that he should never had married her. While he was claiming those horror to Serena, she could not stand more and wanted him to stop yelling. She did not know how to make him stop, but she wanted it so badly that without thinking she took a knife and stab him. While stabbing him, Dave stopped yelling and screamed looking at her. When she finally realised what she had done, Serena started to cry as she did not know how to fix her mistake. Her mother-in-law who was in the bathroom arrived because of the scream and accused her of murdering her son. She called the police to get her daughter-in-law arrested.	15	1	fr	fr	In the news	Covering a news story	By the end of this lesson, you will be able to write about an event in newspaper article style.

You are well within the word limit. It would be good for you to look into my suggestions for your improvement. <br/>  For getting your verb right, you might want to learn up the conjugation table. That will teach you where to place what tense. "I major(VT)(>>majored) in architecture design."<br/>  You have to capitalise the first person singular "I" at all times. "Sometimes)(PU)(>>,) i(C)(>>I) feel tired..."  <br/>  Punctuation plays an important role in language, especially in sentence construction. Good punctuation is an indication of language expertise. "the process of my work.(PU)(>> )I usually face to computer all day". <br/>  Improvement in vocabulary can be done through wide reading. "I enjoy in(x>>y)(>>the) and use software to designer(WC)(>>design) self(WC)(>>my own) architecture."<br/>  You need to take care of spelling.

I think you have made great use of simple sentence structures, for example when you wrote; "There is a sofa in the living room”. However, you have made errors in a number of areas, including:<br/><br/>- the uses of article 'the' such as in; "(AR)(>>The) sofa is opposite the TV". We generally put article ‘a/an/the' before a noun. 'The' is used when the thing mentioned is specific. In this sentence you are talking about a specific 'sofa' (the sofa that you have in your room), therefore you should use article 'the'.<br/><br/>- punctuation such as in; "There is a sofa in the living room,(PU)(>>.) It's large and very comfortable,(PU)(>>.) The sofa is opposite the TV". Please put a full stop at the end of a sentence.<br/><br/>I also want to remind you to keep your submission within the word range (20 - 40 words) so you can practice your writing a bit at a time using what you have learned.

Your writing is very good, with simple and short sentences.<br/>It is important to use the right preposition in a sentence to indicate the appropriate time/ space relationship between two words: "On(PR)(>>In) the first picture ...".<br/>The present continuous tense is used for an ongoing action: "She wear(VT)(>>is wearing) a ...".<br/>The indefinite article is not used for plural nouns such as 'trousers' or 'sunglasses'.<br/>Don’t forget to include your name in the closing when you are writing a letter.<br/>All in all, this was a very credible effort and I'm sure you will do better next time! Good luck with your online studies at Englishtown.	8443	Hi <change><selection>granny</selection><tag><symbol>C</symbol><correct>Granny</correct></tag></change>,<br/>How are you?
